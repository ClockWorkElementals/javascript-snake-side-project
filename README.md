# javascript-snake-side-project

This project was a way for me to keep my programming skills sharp and force myself to step outside my comfort zone in multiple ways. 

At the original time of programming (02/07/23) my winter semester was still in the beginning stage of work. I hadn't ever coded a game, and I despise JavaScript, so I decided the best idea for a project was to tackle both of those weaknesses in my skillset at the same time.

This project is in need of an overhaul as my skills (and hatred for JavaScript) have grown considerably.

Signifigant credit goes to [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/3-snake-game) who's tutorial gave me the starting point for my code to evolve from.
